# Notes: PACT Act Wizard Usability Testing

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. I understand you are a (*Veteran / Family member).* Is that right? 
	- *(If Family member, confirm:)* Are you a family member of a Veteran? Are you also a Veteran yourself?
	- Thanks for confirming that.

1. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)*

1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, or put it in the Zoom chat. *(RECORD)* 

1. Do you have any experience with VA health care? 

1. Do you get disability compensation from VA?

1. Are you familiar with the PACT Act?  

    - *(If Y)* Have you applied for VA benefits under the PACT Act?
      - *(If Y)* Can you tell me about your experience? *(when, how, results)*

    - *(If N)* No problem. You'll learn about it as we go through this session.

Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the web page that I'm going to show you. I'd like you to try to use it, and please share **your feedback** while you're doing that. I'm interested in your impressions of what you see, any questions that you have, and how you feel about what you're doing. I'd like you to talk to me about what you're thinking and what you plan to do BEFORE selecting anything.

What does this mean to you?

What would you do now?

*(When all done with feedback on this page...)* Now I'm going to show you a different version of what you might see, which does NOT correspond to your answers to the questions, but I'd like you to take a look at it anyway. 

Could you please select "Continue"?

  
### Task 5: [Results screen--You may be eligible]
