# Accredited Representation Management (ARM)

_Formerlly known as Find a Representative (FAR)_

The Accredited Representation Management (ARM) team is part of the Accredited Reps Crew in the OCTO Benefits Portfolio.

This product is being revisited in 2023 with the goal of migrating the Veteran experience around finding a representative from the legacy eBenefits platform, to VA.gov.

**Mission**: Create a high-quality accessible service or suite of services within VA.gov to serve Veterans in managing their Power of Attorney (PoA) representation and to support the deprecation of the legacy system used to take those actions.
