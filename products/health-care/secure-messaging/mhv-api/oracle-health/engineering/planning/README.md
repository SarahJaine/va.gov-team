## OCTO Question

Q: What does Oct 24 mean? Do we want production Veterans using the tools? Are we expecting feature completion or MVP? How hard is this deadline?
A: Demonstrable progress with some partially baked solutions that real users use unsupervised. 

Q: Just looking ahead, after the surge, where should the engineering team focus on? Is it in the cards for us to continue this high focus on this
A: For this PI, yes. 

Q: Would getting BL to hire a team for the PI after next to support this new system would be in the cards?
A: No, but we can rearrange resources. 

Q: How hard can we push that OH should be the Source of truth around SM data? Can we (politically/contractually) push to cut out MHV for OH+SM and create a separate pathway that doesn't need to go through MHV, or is MHV the fly in the ointment?
A: Fly in the ointment.
