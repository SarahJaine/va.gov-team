# The plan 

## PI 13 

> Dec 23 -> Feb 24

### Resources

- 2 engineers embedded mostly full time (75%)
- 1 engineers supporting (10%)

### Outcomes

- Create Prototypes built against mocks to help drive architecture decisions
- Establish a mock API to use while OH is not available
- Refine architecture 
  - Determine the viability of the approach and drive an iterative approach based on facts found
  - Land on a target `perfect world` solution to drive towards
  - Document risks with all the approaches

## PI 14

> Feb 24 -> Apr 24

### Resources

- 2 engineers embedded mostly full time (75%)
- 1 engineers supporting (10%)

### Outcomes

- Work on getting Integration with OH happening
- Aid in breaking down technical requirements 
- Continue to iteration on Mock API if needed
- Figure out Pooling by using a `delivery as a strategy` approach
- Figure out Threading by using a `delivery as a strategy` approach


## PI 15

> Apr 24 -> June 24

### Resources

- 2 engineers mostly full time (75%)
- 1 engineers supporting (10%)

### Outcomes

- Ship a very bare bones unified MVP to va.gov of sending and receiving messages
- Nail down monitors and analytics 
- Figure out Testing strategy

## PI 16

> June 24 -> Aug 24

### Resources

- 2 engineers mostly full time (75%)
- 1 engineers supporting (10%)

### Outcomes

- Iterate on how the pilot is going

## PI 17

> Aug 24 -> Oct 24

### Resources

???

### Outcomes

- Continue to be be awesome

## PI 18

> Oct 24 -> Dec 24

### Resources

???

### Outcomes

- Ship some version of a unified SM on va.gov for a `friends and family+` audience, will most likely not be 100% feature parity
