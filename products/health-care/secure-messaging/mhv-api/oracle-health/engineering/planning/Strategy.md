# The plan 

> NOTE: Dates are estimated

## North Stars

- Create momentum by providing resources to help fill gaps and Get Things Done<sup>tm</sup> 
- Be able to operate in an iterative/agile way against the overly strict development culture driving MHV.
- Act as an engineering stakeholders to keep contractors aligned
- Elevate the culture at MHV 

## High level road map


> Iteration is key

We need to solve the integration problem first with the MHV team. Using the current approach, we will be able to work around API development and work with OH to solve these problems. 

For Oct 24, we will help MHV build the current plan with the accepted risks and constraints. This iteration will help solve the integration problems with OH, and we will build the first version with the ability to pivot quickly in mind. 

Once we hit an MVP of 

- Sending a message to OH from MHV
- Sending a message to MHV from OH

Using the current design, we can start to iterate towards this new solution. 

This round-trip MVP will allow us to solve/mitigate/learn some of the integration problems.

We will pivot to this new architecture if things aren't working (we don't think they will).


## PI 13 

> Dec 23 -> Feb 24

### Resources

- 2 engineers embedded mostly full-time (75%)
- 1 engineers supporting (10%)

### Outcomes

- Create Prototypes built against mocks to help drive architecture decisions
- Establish a mock API to use while OH is not available
- Refine architecture 
  - Determine the viability of the approach and drive an iterative approach based on facts found
  - Land on a target `perfect world` solution to drive towards
  - Document risks with all the approaches

## PI 14

> Feb 24 -> Apr 24

### Resources

- 2 engineers embedded mostly full-time (75%)
- 1 engineers supporting (10%)

### Outcomes

- Work on getting Integration with OH happening
- Aid in breaking down technical requirements 
- Continue to iteration on Mock API if needed
- Figure out Pooling by using a `delivery as a strategy` approach
- Figure out Threading by using a `delivery as a strategy` approach


## PI 15

> Apr 24 -> June 24

### Resources

- 2 engineers, mostly full time (75%)
- 1 engineers supporting (10%)

### Outcomes

- Ship a very bare-bones unified MVP to va.gov for sending and receiving messages
- Nail down monitors and analytics 
- Figure out a Testing strategy

## PI 16

> June 24 -> Aug 24

### Resources

- 2 engineers, mostly full time (75%)
- 1 engineers supporting (10%)

### Outcomes

- Iterate on how the pilot is going

## PI 17

> Aug 24 -> Oct 24

### Resources

???

### Outcomes

- Continue to be awesome

## PI 18

> Oct 24 -> Dec 24

### Resources

???

### Outcomes

- Ship some version of a unified SM on va.gov for a `friends and family+` audience, which will most likely not be 100% feature parity
