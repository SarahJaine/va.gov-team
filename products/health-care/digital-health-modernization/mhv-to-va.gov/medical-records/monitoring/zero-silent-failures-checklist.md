# MHV on VA.gov Medical Records - Zero Silent Failures checklist
- Last updated: 09/27/2024
---

* Does your application have a user-facing transaction that is submitted to a back-end system?
For Medical Records, we do NOT have any user entered data submitted to a backend system.  One exception to this is that users are able to change their opt in/out out setting via our settings page. 
That change is submitted to the backend and the user is provided a success or error message.   For various domains (below) we do call various backend systems to RETRIEVE data, therefore we are marking those as 'Yes'.

If you answered yes to any of these questions then go through the following [checklist](#checklist) as a team exercise to determine if your application has silent failures.

### Checklist

#### Start

* [X] Do you know when your applications shipped to production?
  * If not, use Github to determine, roughly, when your application shipped to users.
    
##### Ship Dates:
  - Allergies: Sep 2023
  - Vaccines: Nov 2023
  - Vitals: Feb 2024
  - Health Conditions: May 2024
  - Care Notes and Summaries: May 2024
  - Lab and Test Results: Sep 2024
  - Blue Button: Developed, but currently behind feature flag (not shipped)
  - Continuity of Care Document: Not yet completed

* [X] Do your applications use the same APIs when it shipped as it does today?
  - Allergies:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Vaccines:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Vitals:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Health Conditions:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Care Notes and Summaries:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Lab and Test Results:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Blue Button:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Continuity of Care Document:
    - [ ] Yes     
    - [ ] No
    - [X] Still Being Developed, so N/A
  - Settings Page:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
If not, then you'll need to consider the path user data took through both the current architecture and the previous architecture. You will need to account for potential failures in all paths since your application shipped.

#### Monitoring
* [ ] Do you monitor the APIs that you submit to via Datadog?
  - Allergies:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Vaccines:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No

  * If not, [implement tagging standards](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/monitor-tagging-standards). Adding the [dependency tag](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/monitor-tagging-standards#MonitorTaggingStandards-Recommended:dependency) is highly recommended!

* [X] Do errors detected by Datadog go into a Slack notifications channel?
All monitors referenced in the above section do sent notifications to Slack.

  * If not, start directing errors in Datadog to a dedicated Slack channel. See [#veteran-facing-forms-notifications](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C063SM22J3H) for an example.
    
  * Link to channel where alerts are populated: mhv-on-vagov-alerts

* [X] Does more than one person look at the Slack notifications channel containing errors on a daily basis?
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No

  * If not, then follow this [guide on managing errors](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/platform/practices/zero-silent-failures/managing-errors.md)

* [X] Do the team members monitoring the Slack channel have a system for acknowledging and responding to the errors that appear there?
     - [X] Yes     
     - [ ] No

  * If not, then follow this [guide on managing errors](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/platform/practices/zero-silent-failures/managing-errors.md)

-   Link to Playbook: **TBD create playbook from this template https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/platform/practices/zero-silent-failures/endpoint-monitoring-playbook-template.md**

⚠️ **Failure to have endpoint monitoring in place is a blocking QA standard at Staging review as of 9/10/24.** If you answered no to any of the questions above, you will be blocked from shipping at the Staging review touchpoint in Collab Cycle.

#### Reporting errors
* [X] Have you filed issues for errors that are appearing in Datadog / Slack?
Errors that appear in Datadog/Slack are triaged and addressed accordingly.  Sometimes the errors are resolved or explained with simple Slack communication.  If errors result in the need for further development, a JIRA ticket is filed and prioritized with the appopriate Product Owners.  

  * If not, then start filing Github issues for new categories of errors following [this guidance](#file-silent-errors-issues-in-github)


* [X] Do all fatal errors thrown in your application end up visible to the end user either in the user interface or via email?
We are answering 'No' for various domains below as there is two scnearios that can impact all of the domains where we have identified a silent error.  This issue will be created and prioritized for development.
**Scenario 1** - If a user has not visited MHV since our FHIR server was deployed, they will have no records in the FHIR database. Then, if they visit VA.gov MR and PHR refresh fails, the user may falsely get a message saying they have no records.  https://jira.devops.va.gov/browse/MHV-62496
**Scenario 2** - We are not currently handling API errors from the PHR Refresh Status Check. https://jira.devops.va.gov/browse/MHV-62497

    - [X] No - Not yet deployed, will add monitor when it goes Live

  * If not, then file Github issues to capture error categories following [this guidance](#file-silent-errors-issues-in-github)


#### Documentation

* [X] Do you have a diagram of the submission path that user data your application takes to reach a system of record?
Yes, for all domains with the exception of CCD (in development) and Settings.
 - Allergies:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Vaccines:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Vitals:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Health Conditions:

    - [ ] No
  - Care Notes and Summaries:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Lab and Test Results:
    - [X] Yes     
    - [ ] No
  - Blue Button:

    - [X] Still Being Developed, so N/A
  - Settings Page:
    - [ ] Yes     
    - [X] No - Not yet deployed, will add monitor when it goes Live
 
  * If not, then [create a user data flow diagram](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/platform/practices/zero-silent-failures/how-to-create-a-user-data-flow-diagram.md) that captures this information. 
  * Link to data flow diagram:  **TBD - Need help creating blank MURAL so Mike can transfer the flows over**
The MURAL that is created is by flow path, meaning some domains retreive data in the same manner and therefore share a path (for example, all FHIR data represents domains that are FHIR-ized retrieving data).

* [X] Do you understand how the error is handled when each system in the submission path fails, is down for maintenance, or is completely down? This should be captured in the data flow diagram or a separate document.
When backend systems or domains are down for maintenance, we utilize PagerDuty to setup appropriate outage messaging and notifications.  The following answers refer to when the submission path fails.

    - [ ] No

  * If not, then create documentation that captures how errors in each system are handled. Detail which systems retry a submission and what happens when those retries exhaust. Show this in your diagram.

* [X] Has the owner of the system of record receiving the user's data indicated in writing that their system notifies or resolves 100% of fatal errors once in their custody?
