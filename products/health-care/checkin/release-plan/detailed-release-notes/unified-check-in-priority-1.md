## Description

## Background
The Modernized Check-In Experience Team has received feedback from Veterans and staff that PCI is confusing. Specifically, the feedback includes:
- Veterans and staff donâ€™t understand the difference between pre-check-in and check-in workflows.

## Description
In an effort to reduce confusion in Veterans between Pre-Check-in and eCheck-in, we are planning to standardize the landing page for both applications to align from a UX design perspective that makes use of a task-based design pattern.
