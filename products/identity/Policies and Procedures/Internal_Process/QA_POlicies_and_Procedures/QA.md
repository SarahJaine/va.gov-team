5. **Documentation and Reporting:**
    - Document test cases, test scenarios, and test results for future reference
    - Generate detailed reports summarizing test coverage, test results, and any identified issues
    - Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on testing outcomes

The VA does have a general formal process that evolves as needed. The process ensures that all products include 
- Regression Test Plan
- Test Plan
- Traceability Reports
- E2E Test Participation
- Unit Test Coverage

All of these block the launch of the application except Traceability Reports.
