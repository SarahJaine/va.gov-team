# Sign-in and verification alerts
DRAFT IN PROGRESS, COORDINATE WITH CAIA TEAM BEFORE IMPLEMENTING

**Notes:** 
- Forms should use [to fill out this form] as the [CTA]. Don't vary the CTA for forms.
- Tools should use a brief plain language phrase as the [CTA]. For example, [to refill prescriptions] or [to check your claim status]. Work with Sitewide CAIA team to decide on a CTA for your tool.
- If your form or tool has /my-health in its URL:
     - It may require a registration step on MHV national portal. Currently, only the secure messaging, medical records, and medications tools require MHV registration.
     - It may need to live behind a /my-health route guard with a centralized sign-in flow.
     - Work with the identity and cartography teams to set up the correct sign-in flow. 
- If a form is only accessible after signing in (meaning there is no unauthenticated state of the form intro page), the sign-in alert must appear on the static unauthenticated page that serves as the entry point into the form. Currently, this only applies to 2 forms in the /my-health section: 1010EZR and order form for CPAP and hearing aid supplies.

## Sign-in flow for all forms and tools that don't require MHV registration
