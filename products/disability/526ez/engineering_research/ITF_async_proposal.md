# ITF async proposed architecture and code spike

## Purpose

Gather findings, pose questions, and outline executable architecture that will allow us to make ITF creation non-blocking relative to the 
form 526 flow.

## Terms
- `ITF Provider` - the 3rd party API that we use (VBMS?) to officially create an ITF
- `3PI` - "third party interaction" or any action our system takes against an external system, e.g. lighthouse
- `Non-working state` - any condition which prevents normal interactivity with the described system, be it schechulded maitenance or catastrophic failure

## Resources
- [Slack thread about the continued outages and proposed fix](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04KW0B46N5/p1695064685597689?thread_ts=1694440762.541849&cid=C04KW0B46N5)
- [Slack thread with Micah's review](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04U3EDUR3M/p1695256516348859?thread_ts=1695242442.179589&cid=C04U3EDUR3M)
 
## Acceptance Criteria for post spike work

- In the case that our ITF provider is in any **non-working state**
  - As an end user with an existing ITF
    - I am presented with information about my existing ITF 
    - I am able to continue into the 526 form flow
  - As an end user with an expired / non-existent ITF
    - I am presented with confirmation that a new ITF is being created for me
    - I'm able to continue into the 526 form flow
- In the case that our ITF provider is in a working state
  - **ditto the above conditions**

**TL;DR**
- ITF creation is non-blocking
- A user enter the 526 flow should (almost) never see "Weâ€™re sorry. Something went wrong on our end."

## Axioms
- We are building this to interact with lighthouse
- We want the queuing to be on our end (not LH)
- We need 100% ITF retention and retriablity
- Must not affect functionality of ITF outside of 526
- Sidekiq is not stable enough to be a persistant data source relative to what ITFs NEED to be created
- We cannot lie to the user (we can no longer say ITF was created)

## A User Facing Change?

For the front end we need to create a new state that shows the user that an ITF is **going to be created**.  We can't use the existing success state, as this implies we have already created the ITF, wich could be a legal can of worms if for some reason we fail.  Given this new state, we will almost certainly:
- want to notify the user when the ITF is successfully created
- need to go through the collab cycle

Here is a summary of the change

- old behavior
  - if an ITF exists, show info about it
  - if an ITF doesn't exist, create it and show info
      - if this fails, we end up in an error state
- new behavior
  - if an ITF exists, same... show info about it
  - if an ITF doesn't exist, **enqueue it's creation** and tell the user we ill let them know when it's done, and they are free to continue the form
      - if ITF creation succeeds, notify the vet from the background worker via email
      - if ITF creation fails, we can retry
        - if it keeps failing, we can notify the vet or a dev to get involved



### This as a technical lift

Not to hard.  Basiclly add a new form state, A model to record in process ITF submissions, and logic to enqueue the ITF creation.

- [Frontend spike PR](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/25777)

#### Outstanding work from this spike
- Square this new logic (ITF may not exist) with our existing code.  **This is a potential worm hole!!!**  This requires, theoretically, testing every edge case of every part of the app that uses ITF.
- Test the implementation

### This as a business decision

This is by far the more complicated side of this work.  A few outstanding questions for management

#### 1. what if ITF creation fails or takes to long?
**ANSWER**: Our goal is to allow both ITF and form submission independantly.  If something goes wrong and both ITF and 526 submission take longer than a day (meaning their ITF date will be wrong) then we will have a remediation playbook.
TODO: figure out what our options are with VBA
   
#### 2. What are the UI Implications?
**ANSWER:** We are going to update the UX messaging to more accurately reflect the new process.  
TODO: get Julie (?) or UX involved.
 
### Preflight check list
Once this is built and in place we would need to be certain

- all use cases of ITF to form association have been updated to remove the assumption of a complete ITF
- we have a rollout / rollback plan that accomodates for this changing data modeling
