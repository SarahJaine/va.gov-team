| INTRO                  | 5 MIN        | Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME] and \[NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, let me tell you about what we will be doing.My colleagues and I work on va.gov - making improvements to the site so that Veterans can submit claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. By talking to Veterans like you, we hope to better understand how we can help Veterans submit a strong claim. Before we start, I want to confirm some information with you: - Do you use assistive technology (screen magnifier or screen reader) 

- Which device do you use? 

- Are you able to use it for this study? \[if no to any of these questions, end the study] I have a few things that I want to go over with you:- We have an accessibility expert on this call in case we need any support 

- This entire session should take about 45 \[for screen magnifier] and 90 \[for screen reader] minutes. I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.

- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow some other folks to listen in, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional people listening in during this session?

  - _If no:_ Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

  - _If yes:_ Admit observers.

  - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

  - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

  - _If yes_: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

  - _Moderator starts recording. (_**\*Ensure that you are recording to the account cloud\*)**

  - I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?                                                                |
| WARM UP                | 5 MIN        | Today we're going to be part of the online disability claim form and asking you to imagine you are filling out the form Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.- Talk to me about your past experience with disability benefits at the VA 

- Could you tell me about any disability benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 

  - _If they are getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:_

    - About how many conditions are you receiving benefits for?

    - Do you recall how you filed claims in the past (online or by mail)? 

    - Are you in the process of, or considering filing any new disability claims in the near future? How do you intend to file the claims (online or by mail)?

  - _If they are not getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:_

    - Have you filed any claims previously? If so, what was the outcome of the claim? How did you file the claims (online or by mail)? 

    - Are you in the process of, or considering filing any new disability claims in the near future?

| TRANSITIONTO PROTOTYPE | 5 MIN        | Great! Now let’s get into evaluating the website. We’re going to go through a few different scenarios. I’m going to ask you to think of your own situation as you move through and answer the questions. If you don’t want to do that, then I will provide a hypothetical situation instead that you can use to answer. Are you comfortable thinking about your own situation for this exercise? I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. - _\[If they have filed previously (but do not have current plans in the near future:]_ 

  - You mentioned before that you have filed for a disability claim in the past. I’d like you to go back in time and imagine that you are filling out the form for that disability claim for the very first time. You’ve come to the VA website today and have started filling out the form. You have come to the screen where you are asked to specify the condition or conditions that you are filing for. 

- _\[If they are planning to file a new claim in the near future:]_

  - You mentioned before that you are considering filing a new disability claim in the near future. I’d like you to imagine that you are ready to fill out the new disability claim. You’ve come to the VA website today and have started filling out the form. You have come to the screen where you are asked to specify the condition or conditions that you are filing for. Before I send you the link to the prototype, please share your screen so we can see what you’re doing. If you have tabs you don’t want to show, you can close them before you share. _Wait for screen sharing to work (instructions for_ [_iphone_](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share) _and_ [_Android_](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share) _if participant is having trouble)._ Screen 1 - Start_Instructions on the prototype_- _You are ready to start filling out the form for a new disability claim, and you’ve come to the VA website today to get started._

  - Did they end up using a suggested condition or using free text

  - Did they understand that they can use free text

    - If so, how much did they search before using free text

    - If so, did they use free text for a condition that is in the list

  - Do they scroll through the suggestions

    - If yes, how much did they type before they began to scroll

  - Did they find their condition easily or did they take time trying to decide what suggestion to go with (or whether to enter free text, or edit an existing suggestion)- Copy

  - Do participants read the instructions, if so what was their interpretation of it  

  - Do participants notice the accordion for top conditions, what was their interpretation of it, did they use it_Mock Scenarios_ - _You have developed bursitis in your right knee._

- _You have inflammation in your kidneys_ 

- _Your right knee bothers you on a daily basis. You tore a tendon in the knee during active service and since then the knee has never recovered fully. It is painful when you walk downhill or try to kneel or squat._ 

- _You have chronic congestion and full body aches_ 

- _Your doctor told you that you have Tonic-Clonic Seizures_Questions: - What are your general impressions of this page? 

- Was anything challenging?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS -  | **10  MIN**  | Now I’ll ask you some questions about your experience with each prototype. **General Questions**- What do you think about the list of suggestions that were displayed as you typed in? Were you able to find what you were looking for?

- Did you read the instructions?

  - If yes:

    - In your own words, tell us what these instructions are telling you to do. 

  - If no:

    - Go ahead and read the instructions now. 

    - What do these instructions mean to you? 

- What would you do if you could not find your condition in the list? 

  - \[if they recognize how to enter free text] How was the experience of entering your own condition 

- What would you do if you accidentally selected the wrong condition? How would you change it? 

- I noticed that you….

  - if there were actions/behaviors of interest, this is our chance to follow up on them

    - Did they appear to struggle to decide what term to select? If so, ask what they were deliberating.

    - Were they looking for medical conditions or terms that were not in the suggested conditions list? If so, how did this make them feel? How did they decide what to do next? 

    - Did they use a suggestion as a starting point and then edit the content? If so, why did they want to add additional information? 

- Was anything confusing? 

- Based on the conditions you entered, do you think the VA has what it needs to understand what you are trying to claim? Why or why not?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
